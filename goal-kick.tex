\section{The Goal Kick}\label{sec:goal-kick}

A goal kick is a method of restarting play.

A goal kick is awarded to the defending team when the whole of the ball, having last touched a
robot of the attacking team, passes over the defending team's goal line, either on the ground or
in the air, and a goal is not scored in accordance with \autoref{sec:method-of-scoring}.

The procedure, infringements and rules of the goal kick are identical to those of a direct free
kick (\autoref{sec:free-kicks}) taken from a point 500 \,mm from the goal line and 100 \,mm
from the touch line closest to where the ball exited the field.
