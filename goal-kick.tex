\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item the ball is kicked from a point 500\,mm from the goal line and 100\,mm from the touch line closest to where the ball passed over the goal boundary
\item opponents remain 500\,mm from the ball until the ball is in play
\item the kicker does not play the ball a second time until it has touched another robot
\item the ball is in play when it is kicked and moves
\end{itemize}

Any infringement as listed in \autoref{sec:ball-in-and-out-of-play} is handled accordingly.
