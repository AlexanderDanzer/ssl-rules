<div class="law"><a name="law1"></a>
<p class="law_hdr">LAW 1 - The Field of Play</p>

<p class="sec">Dimensions</p>

<p>The field of play must be rectangular. The dimensions include
boundary lines.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Length:</td>
    <td><span class="new09">6050mm</span></td>

  <div class="caption">
    Figure 1: The field dimensions
  </div>
</div>

<p class="sec">Field Surface</p>

<p>The playing surface is green felt mat or carpet. The floor under
the carpet is level, flat and hard.</p>

<p>The field surface will continue for <span class="new09">675 mm</span> beyond the boundary lines on
all sides. <span class="new09">The outer 425mm of this runoff area are used as a designated referee walking area (see <a href="#law5">Law 5</a>).</span> At the edge of the field surface, a 100 mm tall wall will prevent the <span class="new09">ball and </span>robots from running off the edge.</p>

<p class="sec">Field Markings</p>

<p>The field of play is marked with lines. Lines belong to the areas
of which they are boundaries.</p>

<p>The two longer sides are called touch boundaries. The two shorter
sides are called goal boundaries.</p>

<p>All lines are 10 mm wide and painted white.</p>

<p>The field of play is divided into two halves by a halfway line.</p>

<p>The centre mark is indicated at the midpoint of the halfway line. A
circle with a diameter of 1000 mm is marked around it.</p>

<p class="sec">The Defence Area</p>

<p>A defence area is defined at each end of the field as follows:</p>

<p><span class="remove08">A semicircular arc is drawn into the field of play with its centre at
the midpoint between the goalposts and a radius of 500 mm.</span> <span class="new08">Two quarter circles with a radius of 500 mm are drawn on the field of play. These quarter circles are connected by a line parallel to the goal line. The exact configuration is depicted in Fig. 1.</span></p>

<p>The area bounded by this arc and the goal line is the defence
area.</p>

<p class="sec">Penalty Mark</p>

<p>Within each defence area a penalty mark is made 450 mm from the
midpoint between the goalposts and equidistant to them. The mark is a
10 mm diameter circle of white paint.</p>

<p class="sec">Goals</p>

<p>Goals must be placed on the centre of each goal boundary.</p>

<p>They consist of two 160 mm vertical side walls joined at the back
by a 160 mm vertical rear wall.
The inner face of the goal <span class="new08">has to</span><span class="remove08">may</span> be covered with an
energy absorbing material such as foam to help absorb ball impacts and
lessen the speed of deflections.  The goal walls, edges, and tops are
white in color. 
</p>

<p>There is a round steel cross bar that runs across the top of the
goalmouth and parallel to the goal line.  It is no larger than 10 mm
in diameter, but is sufficiently strong to deflect the ball.  The
bottom of the bar is 155 mm from the field surface, and the bar is
dark in color to minimise interference with vision systems.  The top
of the goal is covered in a thin net to prevent the ball from entering
the goal from above.  It is attached securely to the cross bar and
goal walls.</p>

<p>The distance between the side walls is 700 mm.  The goal is 180 mm
deep.  The distance from the lower edge of the crosswire to the
playing surface is 150 mm.</p>

<p>The floor inside the goalmouth is the same as the rest of the
playing surface.</p>

<p>The goal walls are 20 mm thick.</p>

<p>Goals must be anchored securely to field surface.</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/goal_detail.png"/>
  <div class="caption">
    Figure 2: The Goal in detail
  </div>
</div>

<p class="sec">Equipment Mounting Bar</p>

<p>A mounting bar will be provided 4 m above the field. The bar will
run above the midline of the field from goal to goal. The bar should be mounted securely so that it does not swing
or sway under a small external force, and it should not bend or twist
significantly when the weight of typical video equipment is
added.</p>

<span class="new2010"><p class="sec">Shared Vision System</p>

<p>Each field is provided with a shared central vision server and a set
of shared cameras. This shared vision equipment uses the
community-maintained <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ssl-vision/">"SSL-Vision"</a> software to provide localization
data to teams via ethernet in a packet format that is to be announced
by the shared vision system developers before the competition. Teams need to ensure that their systems are compatible with the shared vision system output and that their systems are able to handle the typical properties of real-world sensory data as provided by the shared vision system (including noise, latency, or occasional failed detections and misclassifications).</p>

<p>Besides the shared vision equipment, teams are <b>not</b> allowed to mount
their own cameras or other external sensors, unless specifically
announced or permitted by the respective competition organizers.</p>

<p>The shared vision system in each field is maintained by one or more vision experts. The procedure of selection of these experts will be announced by the competition organizers. Appendix B describes the duties of the vision experts.</p>
</span>

<p class="dec_hdr">Decisions of the Small Size League Technical Committee</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 1</li></ul>

<p>The local organising committee should aim to provide uniform,
diffuse lighting conditions of approximately 500 LUX or brighter.
No special lighting equipment will necessarily be used to provide these conditions. 
The brightness is not guaranteed nor expected to be
fully uniform across the field surface.  Teams are thus expected to
cope with the variations that will occur when using ambient
lighting.
The organising committee will release details of the lighting
arrangements to the competitors as early as practical.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 2</li></ul>

<p>No kind of commercial advertising, whether real or virtual, is
permitted on the field of play and field equipment (including the goal
nets and the areas they enclose) from the time the teams enter the
field of play until they have left it at half-time and from the time
the teams re-enter the field of play until the end of the match. In
particular, no advertising material of any kind may be displayed
inside the goals or walls. No extraneous equipment (cameras,
microphones, etc.) may be attached to these items.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 3</li></ul>

<p>The specific colour and texture of the surface is not specified and
may vary from competition to competition (just as real soccer fields
vary).  The surface underneath the carpet will be level and
hard. Examples of approved surfaces include: cement, linoleum,
hardwood flooring, plywood, ping-pong tables and particle board;
carpeted or cushioned surfaces are not allowed. Every effort shall be
made to ensure that the surface is flat; however, it is up to
individual teams to design their robots to cope with slight curvatures
of the surface.</p>

</div>


<!-- =============================================================== -->
<div class="law"><a name="law3"></a>
<p class="law_hdr">LAW 3 - The Number of Robots</p>

<p class="sec">Robots</p>

<p>A match is played by two teams, each consisting of not more than
five robots, one of which may be the goalkeeper. Each robot must be
clearly numbered so that the referee can identify them during the
match.  The goalkeeper must be designated before the match starts. A
match may not start unless both teams have at least one robot.</p>

<p class="sec">Interchange</p>

<p>Robots may be interchanged. There is no limit on the number of
interchanges.</p>

<p class="sec">Interchange Procedure</p>

<p class="list">To interchange a robot, the following conditions must be observed:</p>
<ul class="sec">
<li class="sec">interchange can only be made during a stoppage in play,</li>
<li class="sec">the referee is informed before the proposed interchange is made,</li>
<li class="sec">the interchange robot enters the field of play after the robot being replaced has been removed,</li>
<li class="sec">interchange robot enters the field of play at the halfway line.</li>
</ul>

<p class="sec">Changing the Goalkeeper</p>

<p>Any of the other robots may change places with the goalkeeper, provided that:</p>
<ul class="sec">
<li class="sec">the referee is informed before the change is made</li>
<li class="sec">the change is made during a stoppage in the match</li>
</ul>

<p class="sec">Robots Sent Off</p>

<p>A robot that has been sent off may interchange for another robot that
leaves the field.</p>

<p class="dec_hdr">Decisions of the Small Size League Technical Committee</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 1</li></ul>

<p>Each team must have a single designated robot handler to perform
interchange and robot placing when required. No other team members can
encroach upon the area immediately surrounding the field. Movement of
robots by the handler is not allowed.</p>

</div>


<!-- =============================================================== -->
<div class="law"><a name="law4"></a>
<p class="law_hdr">LAW 4 - The Robotic Equipment</p>

<p class="sec">Safety</p>

<p>A robot must not have in its construction anything that is
dangerous to itself, another robot or humans.</p>

<p class="sec">Shape</p>

<p>A robot must fit inside a 180 mm diameter cylinder<span class="new09"> and have a height of 150 mm or less.</span> <span class="new2010">Additionally, a robot's top area must adhere to the Standard Pattern size and surface constraints as described further below in this Law.</span></p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/robot_size.png"/>
  <div class="caption">
    Figure 3: The maximum robot dimensions
  </div>
</div>

<p class="sec">Locomotion</p>

<p>Robot wheels (or other surfaces that contact the playing surface)
must be made of a material that does not harm the playing surface.</p>

<p class="sec">Wireless Communication</p>

<p>Robots can use wireless communication to computers or networks
located off the field.</p>

<span class="new2010">

<p class="sec">Team Color</p>

<p>Before a game, each of the two teams has a color assigned, namely
yellow or blue. All teams must be able to be either yellow or blue color. The assigned team color is used as the center marker color for all of the team's robots. The detailed layout of the markers is described in the following section "Standard Pattern". 

</p>

<p class="sec">Standard Pattern</p>
<p>All participating teams must adhere to the given operating
requirements of the shared vision system (also see <a href="#law5">Law 1</a>). In particular, teams are
required to use a certain set of standardized colors and patterns
on top of their robots.</p>

<p>To ensure compatibility with the standardized patterns for the shared vision system, all teams must ensure that all robots have a flat surface with sufficient space available on the top side. The color of the robot top must be black or dark grey and have a matte (non-shiny) finish to reduce glare. The SSL-Vision standard pattern is guaranteed to fit within a circle of radius 85mm that is linearly cut off on the front side of the robot to a distance of 55mm from the center, as shown in Figure 4. Teams must ensure that their robot tops fully enclose this area.</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/robot_hat.png"/>
  <div class="caption">
    Figure 4: The Minimum Robot Top Area
  </div>
</div>
</p>

<p>The standard pattern to be used by all teams at RoboCup 2011 is shown in Figure 5. Note, that the organizers reserve the right to change this pattern at any time, if required. Teams must therefore make sure to still adhere to the standard robot top area size as outlined in Figure 4.</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/standard_pattern2010.png"/>
  <div class="caption">
    Figure 5: The Standard Pattern for RoboCup 2011
  </div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Each robot must use the standardized pattern with a unique color assignment selected from a standardized set of possible color combinations. No two robots are allowed to use the same color assignment. The center dot color determines the team and is either blue or yellow. Standardized colored paper or cardstock for all required colors will be provided at the competition. The set of legal color assignments is shown in Figure 6. Note, that the organizers reserve the right to change these color assignments at any time, if required.</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/standard_colors2010.png"/>
  <div class="caption">
    Figure 6: The Standard Color Assignments for RoboCup 2011
  </div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Teams are encouraged to select color assignments with ID 0-7 because they have been experimentally found more stable, as there is no risk that the back two dots "color-bleed" into each other.</p>

</span>


<p class="sec">Autonomy</p>

<p>The robotic equipment is to be fully autonomous. Human operators
are not permitted to enter any information into the equipment during a
match, except at half time or during a time-out.</p>

<p class="sec">Dribbling</p>

<p>Dribbling devices that actively exert backspin on the ball, which
keep the ball in contact with the robot are permitted under certain
conditions.  The spin exerted on the ball must be perpendicular to the
plane of the field.  Vertical or partially vertical dribbling bars,
also known as side dribblers, are not permitted.  The use of dribbling
devices is also restricted as per Law 12, Indirect Free Kicks.</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/dribblers_1.png"/>
  <div class="caption">
    Figure 7: How a dribbler may work (check figure 8 for further detail on the 20% rule)
  </div>
</div>

<p class="sec">Infringements/Sanctions</p>

<p class="list">For any infringement of this Law:</p>
<ul class="sec">
<li class="sec">play need not be stopped</li>
<li class="sec">the robot at fault is instructed by the referee to leave the field of play to correct its equipment</li>
<li class="sec">the robot leaves the field of play when the ball next ceases to be in play</li>
<li class="sec">any robot required to leave the field of play to correct its equipment does not re-enter without the referee's permission</li>
<li class="sec">the referee checks that the robot's equipment is correct before allowing it to re-enter the field of play</li>
<li class="sec">the robot is only allowed to re-enter the field of play when the ball is out of play</li>
</ul>

<p>A robot that has been required to leave the field of play because
of an infringement of this Law and that enters (or re-enters) the
field of play without the referee's permission is cautioned and shown
the yellow card.</p>

<p class="sec">Restart of Play</p>

<p class="list">If play is stopped by the referee to administer a caution:</p>
<ul class="sec">
<li class="sec">the match is restarted by an indirect free kick taken
by a robot of the opposing side, from the place where the ball was
located when the referee stopped the match</li>
</ul>

<p class="dec_hdr">Decisions of the Small Size League Technical Committee</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 1</li></ul>

<p>Participants using wireless communications shall notify the local
organising committee of the method of wireless communication, power,
and frequency. The local organising committee shall be notified of any
change after registration as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In order to avoid interference, a team should be able to select
from two carrier frequencies before the match. The type of wireless
communication shall follow legal regulations of the country where the
competition is held. Compliance with local laws is the responsibility
of the competing teams, not the RoboCup Federation. The type of
wireless communication may also be restricted by the local organising
committee. The local organising committee will announce any
restrictions to the community as early as possible.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 2</li></ul>

<p>Kicking devices are permitted.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 3</li></ul>

<p>Metal spikes and Velcro are specifically prohibited for the purpose
of locomotion.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 4</li></ul>

<p>Bluetooth wireless communication is not allowed.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 5</li></ul>

<p>Official colours will be provided by the organising
committee. Teams must use the official colours unless both teams agree
not to.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 6</li></ul>

<p>Adhesives such as glue or tape may not be used for the purpose of
ball control or to construct dribblers.  Dribbling devices which use
such an adhesive to affix the ball to a robot are considered a
violation of <a href="#law12">Law 12</a>, Decision 4, by "removing all
of the degrees of freedom of the ball".  In addition, the use of
adhesives for any purpose on the robot which results in residue left
on the ball or field, is considered as damage and sanctioned as per <a
href="#law12">Law 12</a>.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 7</li></ul>

<p>A rules check will be performed on all robots at the competition
prior to the first match.  Any team's robot which is found to violate
a rule must be modified to be compliant before it can participate in
matches.</p>

<div class="law"><a name="law5"></a>
<p class="law_hdr">LAW 5 - The Referee</p>

<p class="sec">The Authority of the Referee</p>

<p>Each match is controlled by a referee who has full authority to
enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he
has been appointed.</p>

<p class="sec">Powers and Duties</p>

<p class="list">The Referee:</p>
<ul class="sec">
<li class="sec">enforces the Laws of the Game</li>
<li class="sec">controls the match in co-operation with the assistant referees</li>
<li class="sec">ensures that any ball used meets the requirements of Law 2</li>

</ul>

<p class="sec">Decisions of the Referee</p>

<p>The decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play
are final.</p>

<p>The referee may only change a decision on realising that it is
incorrect or, at his discretion, on the advice of an assistant
referee, provided that he has not restarted play.</p>

<p class="sec">Referee's Signalling Equipment</p>

<p>A device will be supplied to convert the referee's signals into both serial and ethernet 
communication signals that are transmitted to both teams. The
equipment will be operated by the assistant referee. Details of the
equipment are to be supplied by the local organising committee before
the competition.</p>

<p class="sec">Signals from the Referee</p>

<p>During a match the referee will signal the start and stop of play
in the usual fashion.  The assistant referee will send signals
reflecting the referee's call over communication links to each
team. No interpretation of the referee's signals by human operators is
permitted.</p>

<p>The whistle signal indicates that the referee has stopped play, and
that all robots should move 500 mm from the ball to allow the referee
to place the ball for a restart. All robots are required to remain 500
mm from the ball as the ball is moved to the restart position.</p>

<p>For a goal (Law 10), or caution or send off (Law 12), an
informational signal will be sent to indicate the referee's
decision.</p>

<p>The restart signal will indicate the type of restart. Robots should
move into legal positions upon receipt of this signal. For restarts
other than a kick-off (Law 8) or a penalty kick (Law 14), the kicker
may kick the ball when ready without further signals from the
referee.</p>

<p>For a kick-off (Law 8) or a penalty kick (Law 14), a start signal
will be sent to indicate that the kicker may proceed.  This signal
will not be sent for other types of restart.</p>

<p>Signals indicating periods of time-out and time lost will also be
sent when required.</p>

<p>The referee will be deemed to have given a signal when the
assistant referee has relayed that signal over the communications links.</p>

<p class="dec_hdr">Decisions of the Small Size League Technical Committee</p>

<p>For all restarts where the Laws stipulate that the ball is in play
when it is kicked and moves, the robot must clearly tap or kick the
ball to make it move.  It is understood that the ball may remain in
contact with the robot or be bumped by the robot multiple times over a
short distance while the kick is being taken, but under no
circumstances should the robot remain in contact or touch the ball
after it has traveled 50 mm, unless the ball has previously touched
another robot.  Robots may use dribbling and kicking devices in taking
the free kick.</p>


<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 2</li></ul>

<p>
<span class="new09">The exclusion zone closer than 200mm to the opponent's defense area</span> during
restarts is designed to allow defending teams to position a defense
against a kick without interference from the opponents.  This change
was added to help teams defend against corner kicks in which teams use
elevated <i>"chip kick"</i> passes directly into the defense area.</p>

<p class="subsec">Cautionable Offences</p>

<p class="list">A team is cautioned and shown the yellow card if a robot on that team commits any of the following six offences:</p>
<ol class="sec">
<li class="sec">is guilty of unsporting behaviour</li>
<li class="sec">is guilty of serious and violent contact</li>
<li class="sec">persistently infringes the Laws of the Game</li>

</ol>

<p>Upon receipt of a yellow card, one robot of the penalised team must
immediately move off and be removed from the field.  After two minutes
of play (as measured by the assistant referee using the official game
time) the robot may reenter the field at the next stoppage of
play.</p>

<p class="subsec">Sending-Off Offences</p>

<p>A team is shown a red card if one of the robots or the team is guilty of severe unsporting behaviour. The number of robots on the team is reduced by one after every red card.</p>

<p class="dec_hdr">Decisions of the Small Size League Technical Committee</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 1</li></ul>

<p>Substantial contact is contact sufficient to dislodge the robot
from its current orientation, position, or motion in the case where it
is moving.  When both robots are moving at similar speeds, and the
cause of contact is not obvious, the referee will allow play to
continue.  This law is designed to protect robots which are slow
moving or stationary at the time of the contact, and as such should be
detected by obstacle avoidance systems.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 2</li></ul>

<p>Cautions for serious and violent contact are a way to discourage
teams from ignoring the spirit of the no-contact principle. Examples
of cautionable offences include uncontrolled motion, poor obstacle
avoidance, pushing, or rapid spinning while adjacent to an
opponent. In a typical scenario, the referee would warn the team, and
expect that they would modify their system to reduce the violence of
their play. If the referee was still unsatisfied a caution would be
issued.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 3</li></ul>

<p>A robot that is placed on the field but is clearly not capable of
movement will be sanctioned for unsporting behaviour.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 4</li></ul>

<p>A robot is holding a ball if it takes full control of the ball by
removing all of its degrees of freedom; typically, fixing a ball to
the body or surrounding a ball using the body to prevent access by
others.  80% of the area of the ball when viewed from above should be
outside the convex hull around the robot. Another robot must be able
to remove the ball from a robot with the ball.  This limitation
applies as well to all dribbling and kicking devices, even if such
infringement is momentary.</p>

  <img src="img/dribblers_above_view.png"/>
  <div class="caption">
    Figure 8: The 80/20 ball covering/holding rule
  </div>
</div>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 5</li></ul>

<p>A robot begins dribbling when it makes contact with the ball and
stops dribbling when there is an observable separation between the
ball and the robot.</p>

<p>The restriction on dribbling distance was added to prevent a robot
with a mechanically superior dribbler having unchallenged control of
the ball.  The distance restriction still allows dribblers to be used
to aim and receive passes, turn around with the ball, and stop with
the ball. Dribblers can still be used to dribble large distances with
the ball as long as the robot periodically loses possession, such as
kicking the ball ahead of it as human soccer players often do.  The
technical committee expects the distance rule to be self-enforced,
i.e., teams will insure their software complies beforehand and may be
asked to demonstrate this prior to a competition.  Referees, though,
will still call fouls for violations and may give a caution (yellow
card) for situations of repeated violations.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 6</li></ul>

<p>The limitation to kicking speed was added to prevent a robot with a
mechanically superior kicker from having too great of an advantage
over opponents, or kicking the ball at speed unsafe for spectators.
It is also believed that this will help encourage team play over
single robot ability, in a similar way to the restrictions on
dribbling.</p>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 7</li></ul>
<span class="new08">
<p>The current rule about scoring after chip kicks is defined in this section (subsection Indirect Free Kicks) only. During past competitions, some confusions occurred after robots chipped the ball and thereby caused own goals. For this reason, a strict interpretation of this rule is provided here:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a robot chips the ball (no matter at which height it travels) at a team mate and the ball subsequently enters the own goal, the opponent team scores. </li>
<li>If a robot chips the ball at an opponent and the ball subsequently enters the own goal while staying below 150mm all the time after touching the opponent robot, the opponent team also scores.</li>
<li>If a robot chips the ball at an opponent and the ball subsequently enters the own goal after having been above 150mm for some time (and not being in constant touch with the ground afterwards) after touching the opponent robot, the opponent team does not score. 
</li>
</ul></span>

<ul class="dec"><li>Decision 8</li></ul>
 <span class="new09"><p>The offence on deliberately entering the referee walking area was added to discourage teams from driving through this area to gain tactical advantages. In particular, it should prevent teams from exploiting the fact that other teams might not have vision coverage of the referee walking area. It is understood that on occasion a robot can enter the area if it is out of control, or if it has been pushed into this area. Such cases should not be considered offences. However, the final decision as to what constitutes a deliberate violation is left to the referee.</p></span>

<div class="law"><a name="appendixA"></a>
<span class="new08">
<p class="law_hdr">Appendix A - The Competition Rules</p>

<p>This appendix describes additional procedures for Small Size League matches.</p>


<p class="sec">Extra Time</p>
<p>If the game is drawn after the end of the second period and the game needs to
end with a clear winner, extra time will be played (as stated in laws 7 and
10). Before the first half of extra time, there will be an interval that must
not exceed 5 minutes.</p>


<p class="subsec">Periods of Play in extra time</p>

<p>The extra time lasts two equal periods of 5 minutes, unless otherwise mutually
agreed between the referee and the two participating teams. Any agreement to
alter the periods of extra time (for example, to reduce each half to 3 minutes
because of a limited schedule) must be made before the start of play and must
comply with competition rules.</p>

<p class="subsec">Extra time half-time Interval</p>

<p>Teams are entitled to an interval at half-time. The half-time interval must not
exceed 2 minutes. The duration of the half-time interval may be altered only
with the consent of both teams and the referee.</p>

<p class="subsec">Timeouts</p>
<p>Each team is allocated two timeouts at the beginning of extra time. A total of
5 minutes is allowed for all timeouts. The number of timeouts and the time not
used in regular game are not added. Timeouts in extra time follow the same
rules as in regular game (stated in law 7).</p>

<p class="sec">Penalty Shoot-Out</p>

<p>If the game is drawn after the end of the second period of extra time,
kicks from the penalty mark will be taken to decide which teams wins the game.</p>

<p class="subsec">Preparation</p>
<p>Before the first penalty is kicked, there will be an interval that must not
exceed 2 minutes. This time is suggested to be used by the teams in dialogue
with the referee and his assistants to check whether the goalie's position is
correct (on the line) and all other rules for penalty can be fullfilled as
stated in law 14. The referee determines (e.g. by flipping a coin) which team defends which goal as well as which team has to take the first penalty kick.</p>

<p class="subsec">Procedure</p>
<p>
During the kicks from the penalty mark, a maximum of 2 robots per team is on
the field in order to avoid interference.
The kicks from the penalty mark are taken alternately by the teams until each
team has kicked 5 penalties. If a decision is reached for one team, the kicks
are stopped by the referee. For all penalties, the rules
of law 14 apply. A second kick (e.g. if the ball bounces back from the goalie or a
goalpost) or a bounce back from the kicker will not score, as soon as the
kicker touches the ball after he released it the first time the penalty is
over. During the kicks from the penalty mark no timeout is possible. Robots may be
exchanged between the kicks following the interchange rules of law 3.
As switching sides would cost too much time and would force the teams to touch
their systems both goals are used.
</p>

<p>
If after 10 kicks no decision is reached, each team takes another penalty in the
same order as before. This procedure (one penalty each team) is continued until
a decision is reached.</p>

<span class="new2011">
<p class="sec">Abandoned Match</p>
<p>In case a team does not show up for a game, the contesting team must still play out the game. The final score for such a game will be decided as for a normal game, with all the laws in effect as in a regular game.</p>

<p>In case neither teams show up for a game, then the score will be recorded as 0:0 for that game.</p>

<div class="law"><a name="appendixB"></a>
<p class="law_hdr">Appendix B - Vision Experts</p>

<p>During competitions, vision experts are in charge of the shared vision systems on each field. The assignment and timing of their service period is allocated by competition organizers. This must be done in a way that each shared vision system always has at least one vision expert assigned.</p>

<p class="subsec">Duties</p>

<p class="list">The Vision Expert:</p>
<ul class="sec">
<li class="sec">checks shared vision system hardware and reports any kind of hardware problems to TC members / local organizers</li>
<li class="sec">does the SSL-Vision calibration procedure whenever needed or when teams request, during setup times</li>
<li class="sec">does the SSL-Vision calibration or maintenance during a match when referee requests</li>
<li class="sec">before each match, checks that both teams can receive the SSL-Vision packets properly</li>
<li class="sec">before each match, checks that both teams use proper standard patterns, that their robot heights are calibrated accurately, and that their received localization data is correct</li>
<li class="sec">monitors shared vision system status during the match and reports any kind of problems to the referee instantly</li>
<li class="sec">receives complaints from teams about shared vision system during the match and, if needed, asks the referee to halt the game to give time to diagnose and fix the problem</li>
<li class="sec">notifies the referee if there is a non-resolvable complaint from a team regarding the vision system. In this case, the referee has the final authority to rule in any manner within his powers and duties (see law 5), including the ability to warn and/or sanction a team for unsporting behavior if the team's requests are unfounded and continue to obstruct the game (see Disciplinary Sanctions in law 12).</li>
